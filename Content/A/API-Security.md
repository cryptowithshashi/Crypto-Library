# API Security

## Overview
API security encompasses the practices, protocols, and tools used to protect Application Programming Interfaces from unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious attacks. As APIs become the backbone of modern applications and microservices architectures, securing them against common vulnerabilities like broken authentication, excessive data exposure, and injection attacks becomes critical for maintaining system integrity and user trust.

## Why it matters
APIs are prime targets for attackers because they often expose sensitive data and business logic while being publicly accessible. A single compromised API endpoint can lead to massive data breaches, financial losses, and regulatory compliance violations. With the exponential growth of API usage in mobile apps, IoT devices, and third-party integrations, implementing robust API security measures is essential for protecting both your organization and your users' data from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

## Core concepts
- Authentication vs Authorization - Authentication verifies who the user is (identity), while authorization determines what they can access (permissions). Both are essential layers that work together to control API access.

- API Keys Best Practices - Store keys securely, rotate regularly, use different keys per environment/client, implement proper scoping, and never expose them in client-side code or version control systems.

- HMAC Signing & Replay Protection - Hash-based Message Authentication Code ensures message integrity and authenticity by using a shared secret to generate signatures. Combine with timestamps and nonces to prevent replay attacks.

- OAuth2/Bearer Tokens - Industry-standard authorization framework that provides secure, scalable access delegation without sharing credentials. Use short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens for enhanced security.

- mTLS (Mutual TLS) - Both client and server authenticate each other using certificates, providing strong encryption and identity verification for high-security API communications between trusted systems.

- Rate Limiting Algorithms - Token bucket allows bursts up to capacity then refills at steady rate; sliding window provides precise control by tracking requests over exact time periods.

- IP Whitelisting Tradeoffs - Provides strong access control for known clients but lacks flexibility for mobile users, creates maintenance overhead, and can be bypassed through IP spoofing or compromised networks.

- Key Management & Rotation - Implement automated key rotation schedules, secure storage using key management services, proper key distribution mechanisms, and graceful handling of key transitions without service disruption.

- Logging & Monitoring - Track authentication attempts, rate limit violations, unusual access patterns, and error responses while ensuring sensitive data isn't logged for compliance and incident response.

- Nonces/Timestamps - Unique one-time values (nonces) and timestamps prevent replay attacks by ensuring each request is fresh and cannot be maliciously reused by attackers intercepting network traffic.
