## Energy concerns & environmental considerations

Energy efficiency and environmental impact are critical factors in sustainable mining operations.

- **J/TH efficiency metrics**: Primary performance indicator balancing hash rate against power consumption
- **PUE optimization**: Power Usage Effectiveness improvements through infrastructure design and cooling efficiency
- **Immersion vs air cooling**: Liquid cooling offers better heat transfer but higher complexity and costs
- **Heat reuse opportunities**: Waste heat recovery for heating, drying, or greenhouse applications
- **Grid impact management**: Demand response participation and load balancing with utility providers
- **Carbon accounting**: Renewable energy procurement and emissions reporting for ESG compliance
- **Regulatory pressure**: Local mining bans, curtailment orders, and environmental permit requirements
- **Lifecycle e-waste**: Hardware disposal planning, component recycling, and circular economy principles

## Supply chain & procurement

Mining hardware procurement requires understanding manufacturer landscapes, lead times, and risk factors.

- **Major manufacturers**: Bitmain (60% market share), MicroBT (25%), Canaan (10%), emerging competitors
- **Lead times and forecasting**: 3-6 month delivery windows, capacity planning, and pre-order considerations
- **Counterfeit risks**: Gray market hardware, warranty validation, and authentication procedures
- **Secondary markets**: Used equipment evaluation, warranty transfer policies, and depreciation factors
- **Chip shortages**: Semiconductor supply constraints, alternative sourcing, and inventory management
- **Geopolitical risks**: Export controls, sanctions compliance, and supply route diversification
- **Due diligence checklist**: Vendor verification, payment security, and contractual protections
- **Logistics planning**: Power consumption verification, customs documentation, and delivery coordination
